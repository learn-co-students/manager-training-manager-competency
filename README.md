Here at Flatiron School, we define a **people manager** as someone who oversees at least one direct report, is responsible for said direct reportâ€™s success, and is accountable for achieving team business results 

We have people managers across all teams at Flatiron School and they exist at different levels of seniority (Manager, Senior Manager, Director, VP, C-Suite). The more senior a manager is, the more responsibility they have and are expected to manage. This is illustrated in the Span of Responsibility table below.
